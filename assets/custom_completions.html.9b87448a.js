This brings up our completions. Custom completions work the same as other completions in the system, allowing you to type <code>e</code> followed by the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key and get &quot;eel&quot; automatically completed.</p><h2 id="modules-and-custom-completions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#modules-and-custom-completions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Modules and custom completions</h2><p>You may prefer to keep your custom completions away from the public API for your code.

    def animals [] {

    export def my-command [animal: string@animals] {
        print $animal
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>In our module, we&#39;ve chosen to export only the custom command <code>my-command</code> but not the custom completion <code>animals</code>. This allows users of this module to call the command, and even use the custom completion logic, without having access the the custom completion. This keeps the API cleaner, while still offering all the same benefits.</p><p>This is possible because custom completion tags using <code>@</code> are locked-in as the command is first parsed.</p><h2 id="custom-completion-and-extern" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#custom-completion-and-extern" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Custom completion and <code>extern</code></h2>`,14),x=t("A powerful combination is adding custom completions to "),w=t("known "),y=e("code",null,"extern",-1),b=t(" commands"),k=t(".
