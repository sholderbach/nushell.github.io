This is how definitions could be added by the parser into the scope that the engine could find them. This scope used locks to maintain thread safety. This meant that each variable lookup had the additional cost of unlocking the lock around the scope. The way this was set up also had subtle bugs with how the scope was handled, including corner cases where variables would be visible in scopes where they shouldn&#39;t be.</p><p>In addition, there wasn&#39;t an easy way to do a speculative parse of content like you might with syntax highlighting or completions.</p><h3 id="new-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#new-design" aria-hidden="true">#</a> New design</h3>',7),me=t("In the new design, both the parser and the engine have received a pretty thorough rework.

The above gif shows a very early prototype of how we might implement this using the engine-q system. It works by running actually nushell code at completion time, getting the list of git branches as a list, and handing that list back to the completion system.</p><p>The demo took less than two hours to implement using the capabilities of the new engine, and we&#39;re excited to see how we can make this more general and offer the ability for folks to create their own completions in nushell code.</p><h1 id="looking-ahead" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#looking-ahead" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Looking ahead</h1><p>Engine-q offers some huge improvements to both the internals of Nushell as well as a way to finally check off tasks we know we&#39;ve wanted for a long time (like git completions).
