Up until now, to change an environment variable, you had to update the <code>config</code> settings, and then these changes would be permanent. This makes working with certain kinds of commands, which need some additional environment information, annoying to use.</p><p>With 0.14.0, you&#39;ll now be able to temporarily set an environment variable. To do so, you can use the new <code>with-env</code> command. This command takes the variable/value pair and the block to run once the environment is set:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; with-env [DEBUG true] { command arg1 arg2 }
</code></pre></div><p>Bash, as well as many other shells, use a handy shorthand form, which we also now support. You can write the above as:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; DEBUG=true command arg1 arg2
</code></pre></div><h2 id="starting-things-off-right-1ntegr8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#starting-things-off-right-1ntegr8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Starting things off right (1ntEgr8)</h2><p>Modern desktops have a way to associate file types with applications and often have a way to run that application automatically when you open a file of that type. In macOS, you can use the <code>open</code> command, <code>start</code> on Windows, and a variety of related <code>start</code> command in Linux.</p><p>In 0.14.0, we&#39;ve added a unified <code>start</code> command that works across platforms that will run the associated application for a file type. For example, if you&#39;ve associated your .py files with VSCode, you can edit them now using <code>start myfile.py</code>.</p><h2 id="nu-gets-a-calendar-josephtlyons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nu-gets-a-calendar-josephtlyons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nu gets a calendar (JosephTLyons)</h2><p>A fun surprise for this release is the recently-added <code>cal</code> command, which will give you a calendar in table form.</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; cal

This meant all of our commands were at the top level, making it more difficult to find what you needed. Additionally, many external commands use subcommands, which meant we had no way to effectively wrap them in Nu.</p><p>With 0.14, you can now define subcommands. Subcommands each get a unique signature which has its own coloring, autocomplete, etc.</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; open myfile.txt | from csv --headerless

We&#39;ve moved all <code>from-*</code> and <code>to-*</code> commands to be subcommands. This change was requested by users as part of an effort to streamline how conversion commands work.</p><p>Another set of changes requested by users was to update the names of some of the commands to the more common forms:</p><ul><li><code>pick</code> is now <code>select</code>. This matches more closely with SQL, LINQ, and shells with similar functionality.</li><li><code>edit</code> is now <code>update</code></li></ul><p>While we are cautious to take breaking changes, we&#39;re confident - judging from user feedback - that these changes make Nu more ergonomic and easier to learn.</p><h2 id="ls-learns-read-directory-sizes-josephtlyons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ls-learns-read-directory-sizes-josephtlyons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>ls</code> learns read directory sizes (JosephTLyons)</h2><p>A few users have wondered why Nu doesn&#39;t print the full directory size as part of <code>ls</code>. With 0.14, you&#39;ll now be able to get just that with the new <code>--du</code> argument to <code>ls</code>. Note: this isn&#39;t enabled by default as calculating the directory size can take quite a lot of processing.</p><h2 id="startup-speedups-fdncred" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#startup-speedups-fdncred" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Startup speedups (fdncred)</h2><p>It&#39;s important to make a good first impression, and with this release Nu gets a speed boost for the initial startup. It will now load plugins in parallel rather than one after another. In some cases, this can lead to startups 3x-4x faster than previous versions.</p><h2 id="auto-cd-speedups-quebin31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#auto-cd-speedups-quebin31" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Auto-cd speedups (quebin31)</h2><p>We&#39;ve also gotten a boost when using the automatic change directory.

The <code>$it</code> variable has always implied iteration (<code>$it</code> gets the name from iteration, item, and being &quot;it&quot;). In 0.14, we&#39;ve made this more explicit with an expansion that happens inside of Nu.</p><p>Now, with Nu sees an <code>$it</code>, it expands it to a full <code>each</code> call.</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | echo $it.name
</code></pre></div><p>Internally, now expands to:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | each { echo $it.name }
</code></pre></div><p>This helps us be more uniform about when iteration will happen. We&#39;ve also updated how externals are handled so they can take advantage of this, making them work a lot more closely with how internals work.</p><h2 id="doc-and-book-updates-nespera-jonathandturner-fdncred-jzaefferer-siedentop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doc-and-book-updates-nespera-jonathandturner-fdncred-jzaefferer-siedentop" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Doc and book updates (nespera, jonathandturner, fdncred, jzaefferer, siedentop)</h2><p>We&#39;re continuing to fill out help information on each of the commands.
