The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development. Thus, rather than being either a shell, or a programming language, Nushell connects both by bringing a rich programming language and a full-featured shell together into one package.</p><p>Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory: traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, gradually typed languages like TypeScript, functional programming, systems programming, and more. But rather than trying to be a jack of all trades, Nu focuses its energy on doing a few things well:</p><ul><li>Being a flexible cross-platform shell with a modern feel</li><li>Solving problems as a modern programming language that works with the structure of your data</li><li>Giving clear error messages and clean IDE support</li></ul><h2 id="this-book" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#this-book" aria-hidden="true">#</a> This Book</h2><p>The book is split into chapters which are further broken down into sections.
