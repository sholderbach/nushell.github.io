To this end, we&#39;ve now added the <code>startup</code> config variable. Adding a table of strings to this config variable enables you to run all of these commands as Nu starts up.</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; config --set [startup [&quot;alias myecho [msg] { echo $msg }&quot;]]

In addition to the common <code>..</code>, to go back to the previous directory, you can now also use <code>...</code> to go back two directories, <code>....</code> to go back three, and so on.</p><h2 id="semicolon-support-jonathandturner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#semicolon-support-jonathandturner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Semicolon support (jonathandturner)</h2><p>A long standing annoyance when using Nu day in and day out is that you can&#39;t compose two different pipelines together. Sometimes you want to run a build, and then run the output of the build if it succeeds.</p><p>In Bash, you might do something like this:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; make &amp;&amp; ./run/my/app
</code></pre></div><p>If make succeeds, then your app runs. We&#39;re introducing the &#39;;&#39; separator which does this (beware bash users that this &#39;;&#39; will stop if the left-hand fails). You can write the above bash line as this in Nu 0.13.0:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; make; ./run/my/app
</code></pre></div><p>Note that commands that you may be used to printing to the terminal when you run them directly may not print anything when used on the left-hand side of the <code>;</code>. This is because the data comes out and, being structured, it just gets consumed before it&#39;s viewed. If you prefer to see the output of a command on the left of the <code>;</code>, you can pass it through <code>autoview</code> to do this for you:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | autoview ; echo &quot;done&quot;

Being able to parse commands, where each command could dictate how the parser works for that command, is a special challenge of how Nu works. After a bit of experimenting, we found a way forward that quickly seemed to fix some of the long-standing bugs. Not only this, but it opened up the way for a set of new features.</p><p>If you find issues with this new parser logic where code that used to work no longer works, please let us know.

This allowed us to create the first command to take advantage of this: <code>each</code>. The new <code>each</code> command will run over each row in a table and do something for each. For example, let&#39;s say you wanted to convert each row of a table to separate JSON, rather than converting the whole table:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | each { to-json }
</code></pre></div><h2 id="breaking-changes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#breaking-changes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Breaking changes</h2><p>With the math operations above, we&#39;re now changing the default type of syntax in a block. Where as before, the expanded version of where was:</p><p>(0.12.0)</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | where { $it.size &gt; 10kb }
</code></pre></div><p>(0.13.0)</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | where { = $it.size &gt; 10kb }
</code></pre></div><p>This is because blocks are now pipelines by default, so you need the extra <code>=</code> to switch into the math mode, which allows using the comparison operator <code>&gt;</code>.</p><p>You can also still use the shorthand versions of these comparisons:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | where size &gt; 10kb

Looking forward, there&#39;s a lot of polish we&#39;d like to put on these new features, including updating the book, cleaning up the code, writing more test cases, and fixing some of our bug backlog.
