In other words, Nushell cannot parse code and manipulate its IR during evaluation. This gives Nushell one characteristic typical for "static" "compiled" languages, such as C or Rust: All the source code must be visible to the parser beforehand, just like all the source code must be available to a C or Rust compiler. For example, you cannot '),o(a,{to:"/commands/docs/source.html"},{default:n(()=>[Ne]),_:1}),t(" or "),o(a,{to:"/commands/docs/use.html"},{default:n(()=>[Ee]),_:1}),t(' a path computed "dynamically" (during evaluation). This is surprising for users of more traditional scripting languages, but it helps to '),Pe,t(".")])])}const Ce=r(d,[["render",Te],["__file","how_nushell_code_gets_run.html.vue"]]);export{Ce as default};
