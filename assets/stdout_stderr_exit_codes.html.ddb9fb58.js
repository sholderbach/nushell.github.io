Data sent by an external app to its stdout is received by Nushell by default if it&#39;s part of a pipeline:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; external | str join
</code></pre></div><p>The above would call the external named <code>external</code> and would redirect the stdout output stream into the pipeline. With this redirection, Nushell can then pass the data to the next command in the pipeline, here <code>str join</code>.</p><p>Without the pipeline, Nushell will not do any redirection, allowing it to print directly to the screen.</p><h2 id="stderr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stderr" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Stderr</h2><p>Another common stream that external applications often use to print error messages is stderr. By default, Nushell does not do any redirection of stderr, which means that by default it will print to the screen.</p><p>You can force Nushell to do a redirection by using <code>do -i { ... }</code>. For example, if we wanted to call the external above and redirect its stderr, we would write:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; do -i { external }
</code></pre></div><h2 id="exit-code" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exit-code" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exit code</h2><p>Finally, external commands have an &quot;exit code&quot;. These codes help give a hint to the caller whether the command ran successfully.</p><p>Nushell tracks the last exit code of the recently completed external in one of two ways. The first way is with the <code>LAST_EXIT_CODE</code> environment variable.</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; do -i { external }
