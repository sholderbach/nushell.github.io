Up until now, to change an environment variable, you had to update the <code>config</code> settings, and then these changes would be permanent. This makes working with certain kinds of commands, which need some additional environment information, annoying to use.</p><p>With 0.14.0, you&#39;ll now be able to temporarily set an environment variable. To do so, you can use the new <code>with-env</code> command. This command takes the variable/value pair and the block to run once the environment is set:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; with-env [DEBUG true] { command arg1 arg2 }
</code></pre></div><p>Bash, as well as many other shells, use a handy shorthand form, which we also now support. You can write the above as:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; DEBUG=true command arg1 arg2
</code></pre></div><h2 id="starting-things-off-right-1ntegr8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#starting-things-off-right-1ntegr8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Starting things off right (1ntEgr8)</h2><p>Modern desktops have a way to associate file types with applications and often have a way to run that application automatically when you open a file of that type. In macOS, you can use the <code>open</code> command, <code>start</code> on Windows, and a variety of related <code>start</code> command in Linux.</p><p>In 0.14.0, we&#39;ve added a unified <code>start</code> command that works across platforms that will run the associated application for a file type. For example, if you&#39;ve associated your .py files with VSCode, you can edit them now using <code>start myfile.py</code>.</p><h2 id="nu-gets-a-calendar-josephtlyons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nu-gets-a-calendar-josephtlyons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nu gets a calendar (JosephTLyons)</h2><p>A fun surprise for this release is the recently-added <code>cal</code> command, which will give you a calendar in table form.</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; cal
